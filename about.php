          Apple products have always been designed for the way we work as 
          much as for the way we live. Today they help employees to work more 
          simply and productively, solve problems creatively, and collaborate 
          with a shared purpose. And theyâ€™re all designed to work together 
          beautifully. When people have access to iPhone, iPad, and Mac, they 
          can do their best work and reimagine the future of their business.</span></div>
